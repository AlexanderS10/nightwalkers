                People are craving spaces to gather and talk about All The Things. 
                I am very interested to see how we grow internationally. 
                It's one of the main reasons I wanted to join - there's so much room to engage more folks globally in the conversations happening on Reddit. 
                
                We do have new roles posted regularly on our careers site: https://lnkd.in/gn_JCreq
            
                I've been getting a lot of messages asking what we are hiring for, and you'll find the current openings directly on our careers site. 
                If you really want to work here, I'd also recommend: 
                - Checking the careers site 2x/week (Tuesdays and Fridays would be my suggestion)
                - Applying right away when you see a role that's a strong fit. Applications tend to be reviewed in the order they're received, and you want to be among the 1st. 
                - Considering the job market being flooded with great talent right now, try to be open to a less-senior title than you may have had previously, in order to get your foot in the door. 
                PS: the advice above applies to all the companies you may be targeting right now! I mean... ours is the best but I SUPPOSE there are other good ones you might want to consider, too ðŸ˜‰`,
